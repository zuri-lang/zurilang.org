# Getting started

## Installing Nyssa

Nyssa comes prepackaged with all Zuri versions since `v0.1.0` and needs no further installation action. You'll need to upgrade your Zuri installation if you are on a version of Zuri lower than `v0.1.0`.

The best way to enjoy the power of Nyssa is to add your Zuri installation path to your shell/terminal environment. If yo have installed Zuri on a UNIX/Linux device using the installation link, you should already have `zuri` and `nyssa` in your path. 

Various operating systems provides different mechanisms for adding a path to the environment so the steps may vary for your specific operating system.

Here's a few links for different operating systems showing how to do this.

## Testing your installation

If you have installed Zuri and successfully added Zuri installation directory to system path, open a new terminal session (may be required) and run the command `nyssa --version`.

You should see an output similar to the below.

```
Nyssa 0.2.0
Zuri 0.0.87 (running on ZuriVM 0.1.1)
```

You can also run the `nyssa` command without any arguments to see the full help information.
